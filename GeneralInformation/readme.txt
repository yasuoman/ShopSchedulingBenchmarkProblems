General Information:
====================

	This page contains information on benchmark J//Cmax, J//Lmax, J/2SETS/Cmax, J/2SETS/Lmax, 
F//Cmax, F//Lmax scheduling problems. The following technical report contains detailed information 
on generating these benchmark problems:

	The Section "C Programs for Problems Generation" contains codes in C language for generating 
benchmark problems. The codes for generating Cmax problems, Lmax problems and quick sort algorithm
 are given seperately. User can down load these programs in his/her system with .c extension and 
use it for the benchmark problems generation. Users are required to provide various parameter 
values for generating the benchmark problems. These parameter values are provided in the following
 section "Parameter Values for Problems Generation". The next six sections provide actual data on
 the benchmark problems. This can be useful to users who would like to access the problem set 
directly. The data set are given in following format:

	number_of_jobs	number_of_machines

	information for first job in terms of routing (machines) and processing times on the routing..
	information for second job in terms of routing (machines) and processing times on the routing.	
	 and so on for each job ....

	If any further information is needed in this regard or to request a copy of the above technical
 report, contact Prof. Reha Uzsoy at uzsoy@ecn.purdue.edu.
